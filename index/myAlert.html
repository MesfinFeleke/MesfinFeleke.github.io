<prep fontSize="12pt"> 1.	Write a small JavaScript application that uses a module for creating different kinds of banking accounts.<br>
    a.	Do the exercise with the basic object factory module pattern. Be sure to validate your code through jsHint.<br>
    b.	You should have a button event handler that uses the module to create an account.<br>
    c.	The module should have a public method for creating the account. That method will retrieve the account name and deposit<br>
    entries from the web page and then set those values into private variables in the account module for the account name and balance.<br>
    d.	You should have an accountInfoList variable outside the module. The event handler will store information about each new account<br>
    in this list and display the updated list each time a new account is created. IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT: The accountInfoList must hold account objects, not Strings.<br>
    e.	You should fill the text area by retrieving information from the accounts in the list.<br>
    f.	Create a simple html page with inputs and button like the example below.<br>
