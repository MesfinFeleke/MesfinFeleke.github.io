1.  Re-implement the following exercises from Lab 5 to use map/filter/reduce Array methods instead of for loops.
Follow the instructions for submitting your code from Lab 5.

/* 4 Define a function sum() and a function multiply() that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers

/* 5 Define a function reverse() that computes the reversal of a string.

/* 7 Write a function filterLongWords() that takes an array of words and an integer i and returns the array of words that are longer than i. */

2.  Follow the instructions for the Decorate My Text lab (below) to practice using JavaScript with the DOM.

When you are finished upload your code to your website and include a link to it on your home page.  In Sakai submit a link to your home page.  Also be sure to include some comment about something you learned in the lab or some difficulty you had to resolve, etc.

You should include the verification links on your html page.

                1.    JavaScript must be in a js file.

                2.    window.onload = function(){
                    "use strict";
                    // put all of your code here

                    }

                3.    (Optional) Use a linter JSHint or ESLint

IntelliJ > File > Setting > Languages&Frameworks > JavaScript > Code Quality Tools > JSHint
 - check 'enable'
 - scroll down to Environments and check 'Browser' and 'Development' and 'Mocha'

 Below is an example of a js file setup to run on IntelliJ with JSHint.  The comment at the top line will
 tell jsHint to recognize JS6 keywords like const and let.  It must be on the first line of the file.

 /*jshint esversion: 6 */
window.onload = function () {
    const okButton1 = document.getElementById("ok1");
    okButton1.onclick = okayClick;

    const okButton2 = document.getElementById("ok2");
    okButton2.onclick = function () {
        alert("OK2 clicked");
    };

    document.getElementById("ok3").onclick = function () {
        alert("OK3 clicked");
    };

    function okayClick() {
        alert("OK1 clicked");
    }
};
